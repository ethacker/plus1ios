# Plus 1 Labs iOS Senior Engineer Technical Interview #

## Architecture ##
Our product team has tasked us with creating an app that functions similar to Tinder, and our team is going to focus on creating the swiper.  This area of the app is responsible for fetching potential matches via a backend API and displaying them to the user.  The user may then swipe left to 'pass' on a potential match or swipe 'right' to express a desire to connect with that person.  Create a preliminary design document that will outline the architecture, libraries, and code structure for this piece of the application.
